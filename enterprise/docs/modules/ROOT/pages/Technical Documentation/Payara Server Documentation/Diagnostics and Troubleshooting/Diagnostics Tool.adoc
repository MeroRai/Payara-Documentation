= Diagnostics Tool

Payara Server has a diagnostic tool that on demand collects the following information from the server runtime.

* `domain.xml` configuration file
* Server logs
* Notification logs
* Access logs
* A JVM thread dump.
* A JVM Heap Dump
* JVM Report

The collection of this data can be targeted towards specific a specific server instance, deployment group or cluster. By default, everything is collected from the DAS, each instance, deployment group and cluster configured in the domain.

If the target(s) is(are) offline, only the `domain.xml` configuration file, server, access and notification logs will be collected.

NOTE: If you are not using the default _domain1_, you must specify the domain to collect diagnostics from.

TIP: The diagnostics tool can be manually upgraded to a newer version in case it is needed. To do so, download the latest 2.x JAR release from Nexus using https://nexus.payara.fish/#browse/browse:payara-enterprise-downloadable-artifacts:fish%2Fpayara%2Fextras%2Fpayara-diagnostics-tool[this link] and then replace the older version into your Payara Server installation under the `as-install/glassfish/lib/asadmin` folder.

[[usage]]
== Usage

The diagnostic tool can be used through the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/collect-diagnostics.adoc#collect-diagnostics[`collect-diagnostics`] Asadmin CLI subcommand, which will collect the relevant data and store it locally in a ZIP bundle that can be used for troubleshooting purposes when raising support tickets on the support portal.

Using this command will allow both customers and support staff to work faster on the investigation and analysis of production and development incidents.

TIP: The `--obfuscate` parameter will hide sensitive data in the `domain.xml` such as passwords, addresses and hostnames. +
Use it if you're afraid of sensitive data being shared along with the domain configuration.

NOTE: The data collected is stored in a ZIP file in your user home directory, the output directory by default.

The resulting compressed ZIP file will have a directory structure similar to the following:

----
deploymentGroup1
├── instance1
│   ├── instance1-domain.xml
│   ├── instance1-jvm-report.txt
│   ├── instance1-server.log
│   ├── instance1-notification.log
│   ├── instance1-server_access_log.txt
│   └── instance1-thread-dump.txt
└── instance2
    ├── instance2-domain.xml
    ├── instance2-jvm-report.txt
    ├── instance2-server.log
    ├── instance2-notification.log
    ├── instance2-server_access_log.txt
    └── instance2-thread-dump.txt
----

Where the data is grouped in sub-folders segregated in all targets (deployment groups, clusters and instances) scanned by the command.

=== Example

The following example shows how to collect the data of all instances that belong to the `deploymentGroup1` deployment group in the `mydomain` domain:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> collect-diagnostics --target deploymentGroup1 mydomain

== Collect Diagnostics with an unavailable DAS

Diagnostics can be collected directly from a running instance in case its corresponding DAS it's not available by specifying the admin port of the target instance (see xref:docs::Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/asadmin.adoc#options[Asadmin Options]), like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> -p 24848 collect-diagnostics --target deploymentGroup1 mydomain
----

NOTE: This command must be run locally on the host of the node where this instance is located.
