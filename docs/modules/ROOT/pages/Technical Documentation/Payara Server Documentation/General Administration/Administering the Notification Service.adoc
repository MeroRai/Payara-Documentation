= Administering the Notification Service
:ordinal: 11

Payara Server comes with a general Notification service that can be used to log events which come from other services, such as the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/Administering the Monitoring Service.adoc[Monitoring Service], the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/Administering the HealthCheck Service.adoc[HealthCheck service] or the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/Administering the Request Tracing Service.adoc[Request Tracing Service].

[[notification-service-command-reference]]
== Notification Service Configuration Commands

The following Asadmin CLI subcommands can be used to configure the notification service in general:

* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/notification-configure.adoc[`notification-configure`]
* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-notifiers.adoc[`list-notifiers`]
* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/get-notification-configuration.adoc[`get-notification-configuration`]
* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/set-notification-configuration.adoc[`set-notification-configuration`]

[[notifiers]]
== Notifiers

The Notification service provides the ability to disseminate notification events through various channels or **notifiers**, which relay them to different destinations.

The following is a list of the default set of notifiers available in Payara Server.

[[log-notifier]]
=== Log Notifier

The log notifier is the only notifier that is enabled by default when the notification service is activated.

The default output for the log notifier is the configured instance's log file, which is either the _server.log_ file or _cluster.log_ file, depending on the instance configuration.

NOTE: The log notifier only handles the output of notifications from the notification service sent to the log and is not responsible for any other log output.

[[log-configuration]]
==== Configuration

Because the log notifier is the default notifier for the notification service it can be configured on the same page as the notification service, as shown in the image below:

image:notification-service/log/log-admin-console-configuration.png[Log Notifier Configuration]

For any new domain, the notification service will be disabled by default. It can be enabled through the admin console as shown above, or via the Asadmin CLI.

To configure the log notifier through the Asadmin CLI, use the `set-log-notifier-configuration` subcommand:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-log-notifier-configuration --enabled=true --dynamic=true
----

To get the current configuration of the log notifier, use the `get-log-notifier-configuration` subcommand:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> get-log-notifier-configuration

Enabled  Noisy  Use Separate Log File
true     true   false
Command get-log-notifier-configuration executed successfully.
----

See xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/Administering the Logging Service.adoc#notification-logging[Notification Logging] for more information on how to configure specific details of the server logging settings.

[[jms-notifier]]
=== JMS Notifier

The JMS notifier makes use of a JMS queue to send notification events via standard Java messages. These messages can then be consumed by a Message Driven Bean or any other JMS compatible client implementation.

[[jms-requirements]]
==== Requirements

To use JMS as a notification target, you will need the following a JMS-compatible message broker.

IMPORTANT: The Payara Server Web Profile distribution does not come with JMS capabilities, so this notifier isn't supported in this profile.

NOTE: The easiest way to configure the JMS notifier is to use the embedded OpenMQ broker, since Payara Server already comes with it by default.

[[jms-configuration]]
==== JMS Notifier Configuration

The notifier configuration requires following a few steps:

. Create a new *JMS Queue* to receive the notification messages from the notifier:
+
image:notification-service/jms/prepare-jms-destination.png[Create JMS Queue]
+
To make this change via the Asadmin CLI, use the following subcommand which mirrors the above screenshot:
+
[source, shell]
----
asadmin create-jms-resource --enabled=true --property=Name=notifierQueue --restype=jakarta.jms.queue jms/notifierQueue
----

. Set the JMS Notifier settings:
+
image:notification-service/jms/jms-admin-console-configuration.png[Configure JMS Notifier in Admin Console]
+
The above example uses the embedded OpenMQ broker's default configuration.
+
To make this change via the Asadmin CLI, use the following command which mirrors the above screenshot:
+
[source, shell]
----
asadmin set-jms-notifier-configuration --dynamic=true --enabled=true --contextFactoryClass=com.sun.enterprise.naming.SerialInitContextFactory --target=server-config --queueName=notifierQueue --url=localhost:7676 --connectionFactoryName=jms/_defaultConnectionFactory
----

[[verify-the-configuration]]
==== Verifying the Configuration

For verification purposes, it may be useful to enable a service to push notifications through the JMS notifier to demonstrate that it is working. To do this, you will also need to set up a Message-Driven Bean (MDB) to consume the notifications and demonstrate that they are being stored in the queue.

. First, enable a service to push data through the notifier. For example, the HealthCheck service's CPU metric can be configured to push CPU metrics to a notifier every _5 seconds_:
+
[source, shell]
----
asadmin healthcheck-configure --enabled=true --dynamic=true --enableNotifiers=jms-notifier

asadmin healthcheck-configure-service --serviceName=healthcheck-cpu --enabled=true --dynamic=true --time=5 --unit=SECONDS
----
+
This also configures the HealthCheck service to send notifications to the JMS notifier, which will cause the messages to be sent right away.

. To consume the messages using a Jakarta Messaging compliant MDB, the following class will work for a pre-configured queue named `notifierQueue`:
+
[source, java]
----
@MessageDriven(activationConfig = {
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationLookup", propertyValue = "jms/notifierQueue"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationType", propertyValue = "jakarta.jms.Queue"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destination", propertyValue = "notifierQueue"),
})
public class NotificationConsumer implements MessageListener {

    @Override
    public void onMessage(Message message) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Message received: " + message.getBody(String.class));
        } catch (JMSException ex) {}
    }
}
----

. View the result of the MessageDrivenBean's `onMessage()` command. In this example, the CPU metric of the health check service was configured to notify every _5 seconds_, so the result of simply printing to `System.out` is following log entries:
+
[source, log]

[[troubleshooting]]
==== Troubleshooting

When you have correctly configured the JMS notifier, it can be used to push notifications to your configured queue.

If you do not see any notifications, check the following:

* Is your MDB or other JMS client correctly configured to consume messages from the correct queue? (e.g. check for typos)
* Are the JMS queue details correctly set up in the notifier configuration? (check the server.log for errors)
* Is the JMS queue available? If you have configured your own JMS broker, is it responding? If the broker is remote, check that it is reachable.
* Is the service using the notifier configured to send notifications frequently enough to observe?
* Is the service using the notifier correctly configured and also enabled?

[[event-bus-notifier]]
=== Event Bus Notifier

The Event Bus Notifier provides a way to send notifications from the notification service into the internal Payara Server event bus, which is based on Hazelcast distributed topics.

IMPORTANT: Notifications sent to the internal event bus using this notifier are intended to be received by internal server components and not by user applications. +
Currently, no built-in internal components consume event bus notifications yet and there are no available APIs that allow applications to consume these events.

NOTE: The Data Grid must be enabled for the Event Bus to be available.

[[event-bus-notifier-configuration]]
==== Event Bus Notifier Configuration

This notifier provides only one configuration option, the **Topic Name**, which is mandatory.

In the Admin Console, simply set the **Topic Name** to a desired name, which will be used to set up the Hazelcast topic that will receive the notifications.

image:notification-service/event-bus/event-bus-admin-console-configuration.png[Event Bus Configuration]

Make sure that the "Enabled" box is ticked so that the notifier will be used. If you would like the changes to take effect without needing a restart, tick the "Dynamic" box as well.

To make these changes via the Asadmin CLI, use the following subcommand:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin set-eventbus-notifier-configuration --topicName=my-topic --dynamic=true --enabled=true
----

To check the current applied configuration from asadmin, run the command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin get-eventbus-notifier-configuration

Enabled  Noisy  Topic Name
false    true   payara.notification.event

Command get-eventbus-notifier-configuration executed successfully.
----

[[cdi-event-bus-notifier]]
=== CDI Event Bus Notifier

The CDI Event Bus notifier provides a way to send notifications from the notification service into the internal Payara Server's CDI Event bus.

These notifications consist of CDI asynchronous events that can be consumed by user applications with valid CDI beans set up as listeners.

NOTE: The Data Grid must be enabled for the CDI Event Bus to be available.

[[cdi-event-bus-notifier-configuration]]
==== CDI Event Bus Notifier Configuration

You can configure the CDI Event Bus notifier from the Admin Console like this:

image:notification-service/cdi-event-bus/cdi-event-bus-notif-config.png[CDI Event Bus Configuration]

The following options are available:

`Enabled`:: Enables/disables the notifier.
`Dynamic`:: Applies changes to the notifier without a server restart.
`Loop Back`:: Whether events should also be observed on the same instance that triggered the instance or not.

To make these changes via the Asadmin CLI, use the following subcommand:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-cdieventbus-notifier-configuration --loopBack=true --dynamic=true --enabled=true --hazelcastEnabled=true
----

To check the current applied configuration from asadmin, run the command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin get-cdieventbus-notifier-configuration

Enabled  Noisy  Loopback
false    true   false
Command get-cdieventbus-notifier-configuration executed successfully.
----

[[observing-events]]
==== Observing Notification Events

Any application deployed to any instance in the Data Grid can observe notification events triggered by the CDI Event bus notifier.

Event  messages are instances of the `EventbusMessage` class, which provides structured data about the specific event type, such as `HealthCheckNotificationData` or `RequestTracingNotificationData`. It also provides the same information in a String form in the `title` and `message` fields.

Notification events can be observed as a standard `@Inbound` CDI event of type `EventbusMessage` or its super-types:

[source, java]
----
@RequestScoped
public class ObserverBean{

    public void observe(@Observes @Inbound EventbusMessage event) {
        var shortInfo = event.getSubject();
        var detailedMessage = event.getMessage();

        var domainName = event.getDomain();
        var sourceInstanceName = event.getInstance();

        if (event.getData() instanceof HealthCheckNotificationData) {
            Optional<HealthCheckResultEntry> mostCritical = event.getData()
            .as(HealthCheckNotificationData.class).getEntries()
            .stream().sorted().findFirst();
        }
    }
}
----

IMPORTANT: For an application to use the `Inbound` annotation and `EventbusMessage` class, it will have to define the xref:/Technical Documentation/Public API/Overview.adoc[Payara Public API] as a project dependency.

[[monitoring-notification-configuration]]
== Monitoring Service Notifiers Configuration

The Monitoring service can be configured to send notifications using the notification service. This allows you to forward data from exposed MBeans to your configured notifiers.

[[monitoring-configuration]]
=== Configuration

The Monitoring service configuration page can be found under *Configurations* -> `<config-name>` -> *Monitoring*.

The JMX page allows you to specify the time between notifications, how notifications will be delivered, and the MBeans which will be included within the message.

[[enabling-monitoring-service]]
=== Enabling Monitoring Service

To configure notification settings for JMX Monitoring, you will need to enable it. Have a look at xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/Administering the Monitoring Service.adoc#to-enable-monitoring[How To Enable JMX Monitoring]

NOTE: You will need some MBean attributes configured for anything to be logged by the notifiers.

JMX monitoring notifications can be done through the Admin Console or asadmin commands.

[[configuring-time-via-admin-console]]
=== Configuring JMX Monitoring Time via the Admin Console

To configure the frequency of logged data, enter both the intended frequency
of logs and the unit of time.

For example, to log every 30 milliseconds:

image:jmx-monitoring-service/jmx-log-frequency.png[JMX Log Frequency]

[[configuring-time-via-asadmin]]
=== Configuring JMX Monitoring Time via Asadmin CLI

To configure the data logging frequency via asadmin, use the following command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-jmx-monitoring-configuration --logfrequency <frequency> --logfrequencyunit NANOSECONDS|MICROSECONDS|MILLISECONDS|SECONDS|MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS
----

[[adding-notifiers-via-admin-console]]
=== Adding Notifiers via the Admin Console

Before you receive notifications from your chosen notifier, please ensure that you have configured the notification service beforehand.

To select notifiers to use for JMX Monitoring, hold the `CTRL` or `SHIFT` key
to select multiple notifiers, and then click `Add >`.

image:jmx-monitoring-service/jmx-add-notifiers.png[Add JMX Notifiers]

[[adding-notifiers-via-asadmin]]
=== Adding Notifiers via asadmin

For each notifier you wish to enable use the following command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin set-jmx-monitoring-configuration --setNotifiers=log-notifier,jms-notifier,cdieventbus-notifier --dynamic=true
----

By using the `setNotifiers` option, you can set the current list of notifiers updated by the Monitoring service.

TIP: You can get the list of all available notifiers by using the `list-notifiers` asadmin command.
