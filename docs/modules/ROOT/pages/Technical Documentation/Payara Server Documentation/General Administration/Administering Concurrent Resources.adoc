= Administering Concurrent Resources
:ordinal: 17

This chapter provides procedures for administering concurrent resources in the Payara Server environment by using the `asadmin` command-line utility.

Instructions for accomplishing these tasks by using the Administration Console are contained in the Administration Console online help.

[[about-concurrent-resources]]
== About Concurrent Resources

Concurrent resources are managed objects that provide concurrency capabilities to Jakarta EE applications. In Payara Server, you configure concurrent resources and make them available for use by application components such as servlets and EJBs. Concurrent resources are accessed through JNDI lookup or resource injection.

Concurrent resources are resources of the following types:

* Context services
* Managed thread factories
* Managed executor services
* Managed scheduled executor services

For detailed information about concurrent resources, see "https://jakarta.ee/specifications/concurrency/3.0/jakarta-concurrency-spec-3.0.html[Concurrency
Specs]" in the Jakarta EE specifications.

[[default-concurrent-resources]]
== Default Concurrent Resources

When you create a concurrent resource, you specify a unique JNDI name for the resource. Applications use this name to access the resource.

The Jakarta EE standard specifies that certain default resources be made available to applications, and defines specific JNDI names for these default resources. Payara Server makes these names available through the use of logical JNDI names, which map Jakarta EE standard JNDI names to specific Payara Server resources. For concurrent resources, the mappings are as follows:

java:comp/DefaultContextService::
This Jakarta EE standard name is mapped to the `concurrent/__defaultContextService` resource.
java:comp/DefaultManagedThreadFactory::
This Jakarta EE standard name is mapped to the `concurrent/__defaultManagedThreadFactory` resource.
java:comp/DefaultManagedExecutorService::
This Jakarta EE standard name is mapped to the `concurrent/__defaultManagedExecutorService` resource.
java:comp/DefaultManagedScheduledExecutorService::
This Jakarta EE standard name is mapped to the `concurrent/__defaultManagedScheduledExecutorService` resource.

[[configuring-context-services]]
== Configuring Context Services

Context services are used to create dynamic proxy objects that capture the context of a container and enable applications to run within that context at a later time. The context of the container is propagated to the thread executing the task.

NOTE: Jakarta Concurrency specifies that certain default resources be made available to applications, and defines specific JNDI names for these default resources. Payara Server makes these names available through the use of logical JNDI names, which map Jakarta EE JNDI names to specific Payara Server resources.
For context services, the mapping is as follows: +
java:comp/DefaultContextService +
This Jakarta Concurrency standard name is mapped to the concurrent/__defaultContextService resource

[[to-create-a-context-service]]
=== To Create a Context Service

Context services can be created by using Admin Console or Asadmin commands.

To create a new Context Service in the Admin Console, go to Resources → Concurrent Resources → Context Services → New:

image:concurrency/new_context_service.png[New Context Service]

Alternatively, you can use the `create-context-service` asadmin command to create a context service resource.

Because all JNDI names are in the `java:comp/env` subcontext, when specifying the JNDI name of a context service, use only the `concurrent/`name format. For example, `concurrent/Context1`.

IMPORTANT: Creating a context service resource is a dynamic event and typically does not require server restart. Applications can use a resource as soon as it is created. However, if an application tried to use a resource before it was created, and that resource is created later, the application or the server must be restarted. Otherwise, the application will not be able to locate the resource.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
. Create a context service by using the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/create-context-service.adoc[`create-context-service`] subcommand.
. If necessary, notify users that the new resource has been created.

[[example-configuring-context-services]]
==== *Example 14-1 To Create a Context Service*

This example creates a context service resource named `concurrent/Context1`.

[source,shell]
----
asadmin> create-context-service concurrent/Context1
Context service concurrent/Context1 created successfully.
Command create-context-service executed successfully.
----

You can also view the full syntax and options of the subcommand by typing `asadmin help create-context-service` at the command line.

[[to-update-a-context-service]]
=== To Update a Context Service

You can change all of the settings for an existing context service resource except its JNDI name. Use the `get` and `set` subcommands to view and change the values of the context service attributes.

IMPORTANT: When a resource is updated, the existing resource is shut down and recreated. If an application used the resource prior to the update,
the application or the server must be restarted.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
. List the context service resources by using the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-context-services.adoc[`list-context-services`] subcommand.
. View the attributes of a specific context service by using the `get` subcommand. +

[[to-delete-a-context-service]]
=== To Delete a Context Service

Use the `delete-context-service` subcommand in remote mode to delete an existing context service. Deleting a context service is a dynamic event and does not require server restart.

Before deleting a context service resource, all associations to the resource must be removed.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.

[[configuring-managed-thread-factories]]
== Configuring Managed Thread Factories

Managed thread factories are used by applications to create managed threads on demand. The threads are started and managed by the container. The context of the container is propagated to the thread executing the task.

NOTE: Jakarta Concurrency specifies that certain default resources be made available to applications, and defines specific JNDI names for these default resources. Payara Server makes these names available through the use of logical JNDI names, which map Jakarta EE JNDI names to specific Payara Server resources.
For managed thread factories, the mapping is as follows: +
java:comp/DefaultManagedThreadFactory +
This Jakarta Concurrency standard name is mapped to the concurrent/__defaultManagedThreadFactory resource.

[[to-create-a-managed-thread-factory]]
=== To Create a Managed Thread Factory

Managed Thread Factories can be created by using Admin Console or Asadmin commands.

To create a new Managed Thread Factory in the Admin Console, go to Resources → Concurrent Resources → Managed Thread Factories → New:

Because all JNDI names are in the `java:comp/env` subcontext, when specifying the JNDI name of a managed thread factory, use only the `concurrent/` name format. For example, `concurrent/Factory1`.
