[[payara-platform-mbeans]]
== Payara Platform MBeans

These MBeans are registered exclusively by Payara Server and provide additional information about current usage.

They are all in the form of `amx:pp=amx:pp=/mon/server-mon[instance-name],type=type-of-mbean,name=MBeanName` where `instance-name` is replaced by the name of the instance i.e. `amx:pp=/mon/server-mon[server],type=web-request-mon,name=web/request`.

See xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/Administering the Monitoring Service.adoc#enable-jmx[enable JMX Monitoring] for how to view all available MBeans.

IMPORTANT: Payara Platform MBeans are only available when AMX is booted. This is done automatically once a JMX client connects. For all other cases, AMX must be either configured to boot at server startup (through domain config) or booted via a JMX operation `bootAMX` on the `amx-support:type=boot-amx` MBean using a non-JMX client (e.g. over a local socket). +
Programmatic activation during application deployment (by means of a Startup EJB singleton for example) will not work.
