[[description]]
== Description

The `create-threadpool` subcommand creates a thread pool with the specified name. You can specify maximum and minimum number of threads in
the pool, the quantity of messages, and the idle timeout of a thread. The created thread pool can be used for servicing IIOP requests and for
resource adapters to service work management requests. A thread pool can be used in multiple resource adapters.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
