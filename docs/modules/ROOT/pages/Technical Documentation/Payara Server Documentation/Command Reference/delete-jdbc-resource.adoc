[[description]]
== Description

The `delete-jdbc-resource` subcommand removes a JDBC resource. Ensure that all associations to the JDBC resource are removed before running this subcommand.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

[[options]]
== Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these options, see the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/asadmin.adoc#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--target`::
  This option helps specify the target from which you are removing the JDBC resource. Valid targets are: +
  `server`;;
    Removes the resource from the default server instance. This is the
    default value.
  `domain`;;
    Removes the resource from the domain.
  cluster_name;;
    Removes the resource from every server instance in the cluster.
  instance_name;;
    Removes the resource from a particular server instance.

NOTE: Resources are always created for a domain as a whole but are only active for targets for which a `<resource-ref>` has been created using the `--target` option when the resource was created. This means that deleting a resource only deletes the `<resource-ref>` element for the specified `--target`, and does not delete the resource from the domain as a whole unless `domain` is specified as the `--target` for the deletion.

[[operands]]
== Operands

jndi_name::
  The JNDI name of this JDBC resource to be removed.
