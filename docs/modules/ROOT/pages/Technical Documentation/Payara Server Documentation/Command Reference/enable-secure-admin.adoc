== Description

The `enable-secure-admin` subcommand causes the DAS and the instances in the domain to use SSL certificates for encrypting the messages they send to each other. This subcommand also allows the DAS to accept administration messages from remote admin clients such as the asadmin utility and IDEs.

NOTE: You must restart any running servers in the domain after you enable or disable secure admin. It is simpler to enable or disable secure admin with only the DAS running, then restart the DAS, and then start any other instances.

By default, when secure admin is enabled the DAS and the instances use these SSL certificates to authenticate to each other as security "principals" and to authorize admin access. The `--asadminalias` value indicates to the DAS which SSL certificate it should use to identify itself to the instances. The `--instancealias` value determines for instances which SSL certificate they should use to identify themselves to the DAS.

The `enable-secure-admin` subcommand fails if any administrative user in the domain has a blank password.

Alternatively, you can use the `enable-secure-admin-internal-user` subcommand to cause the servers to identify themselves using a secure admin user name and password.
