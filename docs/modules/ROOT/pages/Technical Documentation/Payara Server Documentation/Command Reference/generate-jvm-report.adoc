[[description]]
== Description

The `generate-jvm-report` subcommand creates a report that shows the threads (dump of stack trace), classes, memory, or loggers for a given target instance, including the domain administration server (DAS). If a type is not specified, a summary report is generated. This subcommand only provides statistics for the Payara Server instance processes. This subcommand provides an alternative to sending Ctrl+Break or `kill -3` signals to Payara Server processes to obtain a stack trace for processes that are hanging.

The information in the report is obtained from managed beans (MBeans) and MXBeans that are provided in the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE ) or JDK software with which Payara Server is being used.

If Payara Server is running in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) software from JDK release 6 or Java SE 6, additional information is provided. For example:

* System load on the available processors
* Object monitors that are currently held or requested by a thread
* Lock objects that a thread is holding, for example, `ReentrantLock` objects and `ReentrantReadWriteLock` objects

If the JRE software cannot provide this information, the report contains the text `NOT_AVAILABLE`.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--target`::
  Specifies the target for which you are showing JVM machine statistics. +
  Valid values are as follows: +
  `server`;;
    Specifies the DAS (default).
  instance-name;;
    Specifies a Payara Server instance.
  cluster-name;;
    Specifies a cluster.
  configuration-name;;
    Specifies a named configuration.
`--type`::
  The type of report that is to be generated. Default is `summary`. +
  `summary`;;
    Displays summary information about the threads, classes, and memory (default).
  `memory`;;
    Provides information about heap and non-heap memory consumption, memory pools, and garbage collection statistics for a given target instance.
  `class`;;
    Provides information about the class loader for a given target instance.
  `thread`;;
    Provides information about threads running and the thread dump (stack trace) for a given target instance.
  `log`;;
    Provides information about the loggers that are registered in the Virtual Machine for the Java platform (Java Virtual Machine or JVM machine).xref:footnote-1[^Foot1^]
