[[description]]
== Description

The `create-file-user` subcommand creates an entry in the keyfile with the specified username, password, and groups.
Multiple groups can be created by separating them with a colon (`:`). If auth_realm_name is not specified, an entry is created in the keyfile for the default realm.

If auth_realm_name is specified, an entry is created in the keyfile using the `auth_realm_name`.

You can use the `--passwordfile` option of the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/asadmin.adoc#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`] command to specify the password for the user. The password file entry must be of the form `AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD`=user-password.

If a password is not provided, this subcommand fails if secure administration is enabled and the user being created is an administrative user.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
