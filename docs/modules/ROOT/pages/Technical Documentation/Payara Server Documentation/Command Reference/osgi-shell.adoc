[[description]]
== Description

The `osgi-shell` subcommand provides interactive access to the Apache Felix Gogo remote shell for the execution of OSGi shell commands. The
remote shell is provided with Payara Server and used to administer and inspect the OSGi runtime.

OSGi shell commands are executed on the server and results are printed on the client. Because the shell is interactive, no operands are
accepted. Scripting is supported, which means that multiple commands can be executed in sequence from a text file.

A related subcommand is the `osgi` subcommand, which passes a single command to the remote shell for execution. Results are returned by the
`asadmin` utility. For more information about the `osgi` subcommand, see the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/osgi.adoc#osgi[`osgi`] help page.

This subcommand is supported in local mode only. Unlike other local subcommands, however, the domain administration server (DAS) and the
server instance whose shell is being accessed must be running.
