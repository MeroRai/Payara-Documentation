[[description]]
== Description

The `change-master-password` subcommand is used to modify the master password. The `change-master-password` subcommand is interactive in that the user is prompted for
the old master password, as well as the new master password. This subcommand will not work unless the server is stopped. In a distributed environment,
this command must run on each machine in the domain.

[[options]]
== Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these options, see the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/asadmin.adoc#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--nodedir`::
  The name of the directory containing the node instance for which the password will be changed. If this option is omitted, the change is applied to the entire domain.
`--domaindir`::
  The name of the domain directory used for this operation. By default,
  the `--domaindir` option is `$AS_DEF_DOMAINS_PATH`, which is an environment variable defined in the file `asenv.bat` or `asenv.conf`.
`--savemasterpassword`::
  This option indicates whether the master password should be written to the file system. This is necessary so that the
  xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/start-domain.adoc#start-domain[`start-domain`] command can start the server without having to prompt the user. +
  The default is `false`. +

CAUTION: Saving the master password on disk is extremely insecure and should be avoided.

NOTE: If the `--savemasterpassword` option is not set, the master password file, if it exists, will be deleted.

[[operands]]
== Operands

domain-name|node-name::
  This name of the domain or node for which the password will be changed. If there is only a single domain, this is optional.
