[[description]]
== Description

In multimode, the `export` subcommand marks an environment variable for automatic export to the environment of subsequent commands. All subsequent commands use the variable name value as specified unless you exit multimode, or use the `unset` subcommand to unset the variable. If only the variable name is specified, the current value of that variable name is displayed.

If the `export` subcommand is used without any arguments, a list of all the exported variables and their values is displayed. Exported shell environment variables set prior to invoking the `asadmin` utility are imported automatically and set as exported variables within `asadmin`. Environment variables that are not exported cannot be read by the`asadmin` utility.

This subcommand is supported in local mode only.
