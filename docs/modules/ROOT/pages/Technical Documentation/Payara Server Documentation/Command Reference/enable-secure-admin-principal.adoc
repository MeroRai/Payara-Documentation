[[description]]
== Description

The `enable-secure-admin-principal` subcommand instructs Payara Server to accept admin requests when accompanied by an SSL certificate with the specified distinguished name (DN). If you use the "`--alias` aliasname" form, then Payara Server looks in its truststore for a certificate with the specified alias and uses the DN associated with that certificate. Otherwise, Payara Server records the value you specify as the DN.

You must specify either the `--alias` option, or the DN.

You can run `enable-secure-admin-principal` multiple times so that Payara Server accepts admin requests from a client sending a certificate with any of the DNs you specify.

When you run `enable-secure-admin`, Payara Server automatically records the DNs for the admin alias and the instance alias, whether you specify those values or use the defaults. You do not need to run `enable-secure-admin-principal` yourself for those certificates. Other than these certificates, you must run `enable-secure-admin-principal` for any other DN that Payara Server should authorize to send admin requests. This includes DNs corresponding to trusted certificates (those with a certificate chain to a trusted authority.)

[[options]]
== Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these options, see the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/asadmin.adoc#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--alias`::
  The alias name of the certificate in the trust store. Payara Server looks up certificate in the trust store using that alias and, if found, stores the corresponding DN as being valid for secure administration. Because alias-name must be an alias associated with a certificate currently in the trust store, you may find it most useful for self-signed certificates.

[[operands]]
== Operands

DN::
  The distinguished name of the certificate, specified as a comma-separated list in quotes. For example, `"CN=system.amer.oracle.com,OU=GlassFish,O=Oracle Corporation,L=Santa Clara,ST=California,C=US"`.
