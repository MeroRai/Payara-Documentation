== Description

The `list-instances` subcommand lists Payara Server instances in a domain. The list can be filtered by cluster, instance, node, or configuration.

The subcommand displays every Payara Server instance in the specified target, regardless of how each instance was created. For example, this subcommand lists instances that were created by using the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/create-instance.adoc#create-instance[`create-instance`] subcommand and by using the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/create-local-instance.adoc#create-local-instance[`create-local-instance`] subcommand.

By default, the subcommand indicates whether each instance that is listed is running. Options of this subcommand control the information that is displayed for each instance.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

[[options]]
== Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these options, see the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/asadmin.adoc#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--timeoutmsec`::
  The time limit in milliseconds for determining the status of instances. The default is 2,000, which is equivalent to 2 seconds.
`--long`::
`-l`::
  Specifies whether detailed information is displayed for each instance that is listed. +
  The `--long` option and `--nostatus` option are mutually exclusive. If both options are specified in the same command, an error occurs. +
  Valid values are as follows: +
  `true`;;
    The following details are displayed for each instance that is listed: +
    * The name of the instance
    * The name of the host where the instance's node resides
    * The HTTP port on which the instance listens for administration requests
    * The process identifier (PID) of the instance process or -1 if the instance is not running
    * The name of the cluster of which the instance is a member, if any
    * The state of the instance, which is `running` or `not running` +
    When an instance is listed, some configuration changes in the domain administration server (DAS) for the instance might not have been applied to the instance itself. In this situation, the commands that are required to apply the changes are listed adjacent to the state of the instance. The maximum number of commands that are listed for an instance is 10.
  `false`;;
    Only the name of the instance and an indication of whether the instance is running are displayed (default). The length of time that the instance has been running is not displayed.
`--nostatus`::
  Specifies whether information about whether instances are running is suppressed. +
  The `--long` option and `--nostatus` option are mutually exclusive. If both options are specified in the same command, an error occurs. +
  Valid values are as follows: +
  `true`;;
    Information about whether instances are running is suppressed. Only the name of each instance is displayed.
  `false`;;
    Information about whether instances are running is displayed (default).
`--standaloneonly`::
  Specifies whether only standalone instances are listed. +
  The `--standaloneonly` option and the target operand and are mutually exclusive. If both the `--standaloneonly` option and the target operand are specified in the same command, an error occurs. +
  Valid values are as follows: +
  `true`;;
    Only standalone instances are listed.
  `false`;;
    All instances in the specified target are listed (default).

[[operands]]
== Operands

target::
  Filters the list of Payara Server instances by specifying the target for which instances are listed. +
  The target operand and the `--standaloneonly` option are mutually exclusive. If both the target operand and the `--standaloneonly` option are specified in the same command, an error occurs. +
  Valid values are as follows: +
  `domain`;;
    Lists all instances in the domain (default).
  cluster-name;;
    Lists the instances that are members of the specified cluster.
  instance-name;;
    Lists only the specified instance.
  node-name;;
    Lists the instances that reside on the specified node.
  configuration-name;;
    Lists all instances whose configuration is defined by the specified  named configuration.
