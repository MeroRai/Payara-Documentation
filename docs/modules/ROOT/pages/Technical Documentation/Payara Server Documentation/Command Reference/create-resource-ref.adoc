[[description]]
== Description

The `create-resource-ref` subcommand creates a reference from a cluster or an unclustered server instance to a previously created resource, for
example, a JDBC resource created by using the `create-jdbc-resource` subcommand. This effectively results in the resource being made available in the JNDI tree of the instance or cluster.

The target instance or instances making up the cluster need not be running or available for this subcommand to succeed. If one or more
instances are not available, they will receive the new resource the next time they start.

NOTE: A `resource-ref` can only be created for bindable resources, such as a `jdbc-resource`, `connector-resource`, `admin-object-resource`, `mail-resource`, `custom-resource`, or `jndi-resource`. +
A `jdbc-connection-pool` or a `connector-connection-pool` are not referred to directly by applications. Instead, they are referred to through a `jdbc-resource` or `connector-resource`, respectively.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
