[[description]]
== Description

The `delete-jvm-options` subcommand removes one or more command-line options for the Java application launcher. These options are removed from the Java configuration `javaâ€”config` element or the profiler `profiler` element of the `domain.xml` file. To see the Java application launcher options that can be deleted, use the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-jvm-options.adoc#list-jvm-options[`list-jvm-options`] subcommand.

The deletion of some options requires a server restart for changes to become effective. Other options are set immediately in the environment of the domain administration server (DAS) and do not require a restart.

Whether a restart is required depends on the type of option.

* Restart is not required for Java system properties whose names do not start with `-Djava.` or `-Djavax.` (including the trailing period). For example, restart is not required for the following Java system property: +
`-Denvironment=Production`
* Restart is required for the following options:

** Java system properties whose names start with `-Djava.` or `-Djavax.` (including the trailing period). For example: +
`-Djava.security.manager`

** Startup parameters for the Java application launcher. For example: +
`-client` +
`-Xmx1024m` +
`-d64`

To restart the DAS, use the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/restart-domain.adoc#restart-domain[`restart-domain`] command.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

  cluster-name;;
    Specifies a cluster.
  configuration-name;;
    Specifies a named configuration.
`--profiler`::
  Indicates whether the Java application launcher options are for the profiler. The option must have been set for a profiler for this option to be true.

[[operands]]
== Operands

jvm-option-name::
  One or more options delimited by a colon (:). The format of the operand depends on the following: +

NOTE: If an option name or option value contains a colon, the backslash (`\`) must be used to escape the colon in the name or value. Other characters might also require an escape character. For more information about escape characters in subcommand options, see the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/asadmin.adoc#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`] man page.
