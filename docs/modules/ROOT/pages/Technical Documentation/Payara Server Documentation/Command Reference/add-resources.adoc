[[description]]
== Description

The `add-resources` subcommand creates the resources named in the specified XML file. The resources that can be created with this subcommand are listed in S
ee Also in this help page.

The `--target` option specifies the target for which you are creating the resources. If this option specifies the domain, the resources are added only to the configuration of the domain administration server (DAS). If this option specifies any other target, the resources are added to the configuration of the DAS and
references are added to the resources from the specified target.

The xml-file-name operand is the path to the XML file that contains the resources to be created. The `DOCTYPE` must be specified as `http://glassfish.org/dtds/glassfish-resources_1_5.dtd` in the `resources.xml` file.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

[[options]]
== Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these options, see the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/asadmin.adoc#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--target`::
  Specifies the target for which you are creating the resources. +
  Valid values are as follows: +
  `server`;;
    Creates the resources for the default server instance `server` and is the default value.
  `domain`;;
    Creates the resources for the domain.
  cluster-name;;
    Creates the resources for every server instance in the cluster.
  instance-name;;
    Creates the resources for a particular Payara Server instance.
`--upload`::
  Specifies whether the subcommand uploads the file to the DAS. In most situations, this option can be omitted. +
  Valid values are as follows: +
  `false`;;
    The subcommand does not upload the file and attempts to access the file through the specified file name. If the DAS cannot access the file, the subcommand fails. +
    For example, the DAS might be running as a different user than the administration user and does not have read access to the file. In this situation, the subcommand fails if the `--upload` option is `false`.
  `true`;;
    The subcommand uploads the file to the DAS over the network connection. +
  The default value depends on whether the DAS is on the host where the subcommand is run or is on a remote host. +
  * If the DAS is on the host where the subcommand is run, the default is `false`.
  * If the DAS is on a remote host, the default is `true`.

[[operands]]
== Operands

xml-file-name::
  The path to the XML file that contains the resources that are to be created. You can specify an absolute path, only the file name, or a relative path. +
  * If you specify an absolute path, the XML file can be anywhere.
  * If you specify only the file name, the XML file must reside in the domain-dir`/config` directory on the DAS host. This requirement must be met even if you run the subcommand from another host.
  * If you specify a relative path, the XML file must be in the relative directory. +
  An example XML file follows. +
