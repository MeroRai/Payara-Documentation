[[description]]
== Description

The `start-cluster` subcommand starts a cluster by starting all Payara Server instances in the cluster that are not already running.
This subcommand requires the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) remote protocol or secure shell (SSH) to be configured on the host where
the domain administration server (DAS) is running and on all hosts where instances in the cluster reside.

NOTE: If all instances reside on the same host as the DAS, DCOM or SSH is not required. You might require to start a cluster in which instances reside
on hosts where DCOM or SSH is not configured that are remote from the DAS. In this situation, run the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/start-local-instance.adoc#start-local-instance[`start-local-instance`] subcommand for each instance from the host where the instance resides.

You may run this subcommand from any host that can contact the DAS.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
