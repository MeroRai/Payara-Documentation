== Synopsis

[[description]]
== Description

The created file will be located in the serverâ€™s host and not the client. If they are on different hosts, then the file will be needed to copied from the server to the client.

TIP: You can add the resulting file to your bash path by adding source `path/to/outputfile` to your .bashrc settings or copy the file into the `/etc/bash_completion.d` directory.

This means that you can run asadmin commands by typing asadmin in a terminal, and you can use double-tab to autocomplete a command, similar to other bash commands.
