`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--target`::
  Specifies the target for which to list batch job steps. Valid values are as follows: +
  `server`;;
    Lists steps for the default server instance `server` and is the default value.
  cluster-name;;
    Lists steps for every server instance in the cluster.
  instance-name;;
    Lists steps for a particular server instance.
`--long`::
`-l`::
  Displays detailed information about batch job steps. The default value is `false`.
`--output`::
`-o`::
  Displays specific details about batch job steps. Use a comma-separated list to specify the details to display and their order. The values are
  case-insensitive. A subset of all possible headings is displayed by default. +
  Possible values are as follows: +
  `stepname`;;
    Displays the name of the step.
  `stepid`;;
    Displays the step ID.
  `starttime`;;
    Displays the start time of the step.
  `endtime`;;
