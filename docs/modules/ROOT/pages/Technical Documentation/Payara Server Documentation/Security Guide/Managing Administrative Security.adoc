This chapter describes how to manage administrative security by using Payara Server's secure administration feature.

This chapter assumes that you are familiar with security features such as authentication, authorization, and certificates. If you are not, first see xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Security Guide/Administering System Security.adoc#administering-system-security[Administering System Security].

[[secure-administration-overview]]
== Secure Administration Overview

The secure administration feature allows an administrator to secure all administrative communication between the domain administration server
(DAS), any remote instances, and administration clients such as the `asadmin` CLI utility, the administration console's web interface, and REST clients using the Management API.

In addition, secure administration helps to prevent DAS-to-DAS and instance-to-instance traffic, and carefully restricts administration-client-to-instance traffic.

The secure administration feature, which is henceforth referred to as *secure admin*, provides a secure environment, in which you can be confident that rogue users or processes cannot intercept or corrupt administration traffic or impersonate legitimate Payara Server components.

When you install Payara Server or create a new domain, secure admin is disabled by default. When secure admin is disabled, Payara Server does not encrypt administrative communication among the system components, but it *does not accept administrative connections from remote hosts*.

The following subcommands enable and disable secure admin:

`enable-secure-admin`:: The `enable-secure-admin` subcommand turns on secure admin. Payara Server uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect subsequent administrative traffic and will ALSO accept remote administrative connections. Enabling secure admin affects the entire domain, including the DAS and all of its instances. The DAS must be running to run `enable-secure-admin`.
+
You must restart the DAS immediately after enabling secure admin, and then start any instances you want to run.
+
CAUTION: The `enable-secure-admin` subcommand fails if ANY administrator users have an empty password credential assigned. Before retrying the command, ALL administrator users should have non-empty passwords assigned.

`disable-secure-admin`:: The `disable-secure-admin` subcommand turns off secure admin. Payara Server no longer encrypts administrative messages and will no longer accept remote administration connections. Disabling secure admin affects the entire domain, including the DAS and all instances. The DAS must be running to run `disable-secure-admin`.
+
You must restart the DAS immediately after disabling secure admin, and then start any instances you want to run.
+
If secure admin is not enabled, this subcommand has no effect.

This section describes how to use these commands to run secure admin, and the implications of doing so.

[[how-secure-admin-works-the-big-picture]]
== How Secure Admin Works: The Big Picture

Secure admin is a domain-wide setting. It affects the DAS and all instances and all administration clients.

[[functions-performed-by-secure-admin]]
=== Functions Performed by Secure Admin

The `enable-secure-admin` subcommand performs the following functions. Subsequent sections describe these functions in more detail.

* Enables the secure admin behavior, optionally setting which *aliases* are to be used for identifying the DAS and instance certificates.
* Adjusts all configurations in the domain, including the `default-config` template configuration.
* Adjusts HTTP settings:

** SSL/TLS is enabled in the DAS' admin listener and the instances' admin listeners configurations.

** Port unification (that is, HTTP and HTTPS are handled by the same port), http—to—https redirection, and client authentication (`client-auth=want`) are enabled.

** Configures SSL to use the administration truststore.

** Configures SSL to use the administration keystore and the correct alias (for the self-signed cert) for authenticating itself. (You can use a CA-issued certificate instead, as described in xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Security Guide/Managing Administrative Security.adoc#using-your-own-certificates[Using Your Own Certificates].
+
NOTE: HTTP configuration on the DAS and each instance is identical, with the exception that the DAS uses the `s1as` alias for SSL/TLS authentication and the instances use the `glassfish-instance` alias by default.
+
A server restart is required to apply the aforementioned changes. The restart also synchronizes the restarted instances.

[[which-administration-account-is-used]]
=== Which Administration Account is Used?

If only one administration account exists in the default `admin` realm, Payara Server treats that account as the current default administration account. In this case, when you run an `asadmin` command, you do not need to specify a username. If a password for that username is required, you need to specify it, typically by using the `--passwordfile` option or by letting `asadmin` prompt you for it.

NOTE: By default, Payara Server includes a single account for user `admin` which has an empty password.

If multiple admin accounts exist, then Payara Server does not recognize any administrator username as the default. You must then specify a valid username via the `-—user` option when you use the `asadmin` command (or by or defining the `AS_ASDMIN_USER` environment variable), and its associated password (if it is not empty).

The username and password used for a login attempt must match the username and password (if required) for an account defined in the `admin` realm, and you must have set up the account as a member of the `admin` group.

[[what-authentication-methods-are-used-for-secure-administration]]
=== What Authentication Methods Are Used for Secure Administration?

The secure admin feature enforces security via the following authentication methods:

* The DAS and instances authenticate to each other via mutual (two-way) SSL/TLS certificate authentication. The DAS authenticates to clients via one-way SSL/TLS certificate authentication.
+
NOTE: The domain creation process creates a default keystore and truststore, plus a default private key for the DAS. Secure admin uses this initial configuration to set up the default truststore so that the DAS and instances always trust each other.

* Remote administration clients (the Asadmin CLI, the web administration console, and IDE extension plugins) must accept the public certificate presented by the DAS. If accepted, remote administration clients then send a username and password (via HTTP `Basic` authentication). The receiving DAS or instance makes sure those credentials are valid in its configured `admin` realm, and authenticates and authorizes the user.

* A locally-running Asadmin CLI (that is, connecting to an instance on the same host) authenticates and authorizes to the co-located instance using a locally-provisioned password.

* Credentials or other sensitive information sent over the network are always encrypted if secure admin is enabled. No credentials are sent in the clear if secure admin is enabled. (If secure admin is disabled, credentials are sent in clear text.)
+
Messages between administration clients and the DAS, between the DAS and remote instances, and between local administration clients and instances are encrypted using SSL/TLS. This is true even if you explicitly set the `asadmin` `-—secure` option to `false`.

The following table shows which authentication methods are employed when secure admin is enabled or disabled.

.Authentication Methods Employed

[width="100%",cols="30%,30%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Access Method |Secure Admin is Disabled |Secure Admin is Enabled
|Remote administration access to the DAS |Rejected.
|Username/password authentication. (Client must also accept server certificate.)

|Communication between DAS and instances |Cleartext messages.
No mutual authentication.
|SSL-encrypted messages. SSL mutual authentication using certificates.

|Communication between administration clients and DAS |Cleartext messages. No DAS authentication.
|SSL-encrypted messages. DAS uses SSL certificate server authentication.

|Local asadmin client to instance on same node |Cleartext messages. Locally-provisioned password mechanism is used.
|SSL-encrypted messages. Locally-provisioned password mechanism is used.
|=======================================================================

[[understanding-how-certificate-authentication-is-performed]]
=== Understanding How Certificate Authentication is Performed

The domain creation process creates a primary (private) key and a self-signed certificate for the DAS, and a separate private key and self-signed certificate for remote instances.

Then, when you enable secure admin, the following actions are performed:

* Both private keys are stored in the domain-wide DAS keystore file, `keystore.p12`.
* Both public certificates are stored in the domain-wide DAS truststore file, `cacerts.p12`.

When the DAS sends a message to an instance:

. The instance asks the DAS to provide an SSL/TLS certificate.
. The DAS sends the certificate with the alias you specified using the `--adminalias` option when you ran the `enable-secure-admin` subcommand.
. The instance makes sure the certificate is valid and Payara Server makes sure that the security `Principal` associated with  the incoming request (provided automatically by the HTTP engine and the SSL/TLS implementation provided by the Java runtime) matches the `Principal` associated with the`adminalias` from the instance's truststore.

[[what-certificates-are-used]]
=== What Certificates Are Used?

When you enable secure admin, you can optionally set the `--adminalias` and `--instancealias` options that tell secure admin which aliases to use for the DAS and instance certificates.

The DAS uses the alias associated with the `--instancealias` option to check incoming requests that use SSL/TLS cert authentication. Conversely, instances use the alias associated with the `--adminalias` option to check incoming requests with certificate authentication.

By default, `--adminalias` of the `enable-secure-admin` subcommand uses the `s1as` alias, and the `--instancealias` option uses the `glassfish-instance` alias, both of which identify the default self-signed certificates.

You can use your tool of choice, such as `keytool`, to list the default self-signed certificates in the keystore, similar to the following:

[source,shell]
----
keytool -list -keystore keystore.p12

Enter keystore password:

Keystore type: PKCS12
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 2 entries

glassfish-instance, Jan 3, 2023, PrivateKeyEntry,
Certificate fingerprint (MD5): 06:A4:83:84:57:52:9C:2F:E1:FD:08:68:BB:2D:ED:E8
s1as, Jan 3, 2023, PrivateKeyEntry,
Certificate fingerprint (MD5): 8B:7D:5A:4A:32:36:1B:5D:6A:29:66:01:B0:A3:CB:85
----

The `--adminalias` and `--instancealias` values are maintained. Because of this design, normal instance creation operations (create-instance over SSH and create-local-instance) apply the up-to-date keystore, truststore, and configuration to each instance.

[[self-signed-certificates-and-trust]]
==== *Self-Signed Certificates and Trust*

The self-signed certificates that Payara Server uses will not be trusted by clients by default because a certificate authority (CA)) does not vouch for the authenticity of the certificate.

If you enable secure admin and then contact the DAS using an administration client, that client will detect whether the certificate is automatically trusted. Most modern web browsers will deny access to the web  interface of the Admin console and reject any communication until the user explicitly creates an exception to continue. And example is shown in the following figure:

image:security/accept-certificate.png["This screen shot shows how a Mozilla Firefox responds to an untrusted certificate."]

Similarly, the first time the Asadmin CLI receives an untrusted certificate, it displays the certificate and lets you accept it or reject it, as follows:

//TODO - Certificate entries are not printed out.

Do you trust the above certificate [y|N] -->
----

CAUTION: When accepted for the first time, the certificate will be automatically accepted in subsequent Asadmin CLI operations.

The Asadmin CLI locally saves accepted certificates in the `.gf-client/truststore` file in the OS user's home directory. You do not generally need to work with the file directly, but if you delete or move the file, `asadmin` will prompt you again when it receives untrusted certificates.

Some `asadmin` commands can contact an instance directly to retrieve information (but not to make configuration changes). The instances do not use the same certificate as the DAS, so in these cases the command will also prompt you to accept or reject the specific instance certificate.

[[using-your-own-certificates]]
==== Using Your Own Certificates

By default, `--adminalias` of the `enable-secure-admin` subcommand uses the `s1as` alias, and the `--instancealias` option uses the `glassfish-instance` alias, both of which identify default self-signed certificates prepared by the domain at its creation.

You can instead have Payara Server use your own certificates for this purpose by first importing your certificates to the keystore and truststore, and then enabling secure admin and specify the aliases for your custom certificates.

NOTE: In general, in most cases it is recommended to use custom certificates for the DAS as remote access is usually done on un-restricted environments.

It is also possible to use `s1as` and `glassfish-instance` as the alias names for your own certificates when importing them to the keystore and truststore. A benefit of doing so is that you would not have to specify alias names with the `enable-secure-admin` subcommand.

In addition, your own certificate identified by the `s1as` alias would be used in all other cases within the domain where the `s1as` alias is used (by default), such as in the SSL configuration of the IIOP and `http-listener-2` listeners, and as the `encryption.key.alias` and `signature.key.alias` used for provider configuration in the SOAP authentication layer for Message Security configuration.

You may find the wide-reaching effect of using the `s1as` alias with your own certificate to be either a useful feature or an unintended consequence. Therefore, you should understand the implications of using the `s1as` alias before doing so.

If you decide to use the `s1as` and `glassfish-instance` aliases with your own certificates, you will first need to disable secure admin (if enabled) and then change or delete the exiting `s1as` alias from both the `keystore.p12` keystore and `cacerts.p12` truststore for the DAS.

You can also use the `--changealias` or`--delete` option of `keytool` to accomplish this. After that import your own certificates.

IMPORTANT: When renewing an expired certificate (since most CA-issued certificates would have a lifetime of a year in general), you must first disable secure admin, replace the certificates in the keystore and truststore with the renewed certificates and then re-enable secure admin to correctly re-established secure administration to the domain and its instances.


[[an-alternate-approach-using-distinguished-names-to-specify-certificates]]
=== An Alternate Approach: Using Distinguished Names to Specify Certificates

By default, the DAS uses the alias associated with the `--instancealias` option to check incoming requests that use SSL/TLS cert authentication. Conversely, instances use the alias associated with the `--adminalias` option to check incoming requests with certificate authentication.

The xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/enable-secure-admin-principal.adoc#enable-secure-admin-principal[`enable-secure-admin-principal`] subcommand provides an alternate approach. `enable-secure-admin-principal` instructs Payara Server to accept admin requests when accompanied by an SSL certificate with the specified distinguished name (DN).

NOTE: Any certificate you specify with `enable-secure-admin-principal` must either be issued by a trusted certificate authority or, if it is self-signed, must already be imported in the server's truststore.

For example, assume that you write your own admin client that uses the REST interface. When your client establishes the connection, it can choose which certificate to use for its client cert. You would then specify the DN of this certificate to `enable-secure-admin-principal`.

You must specify either the DN or the `--alias` option of the `enable-secure-admin-principal` subcommand.

If you specify the DN, Payara Server records the value you specify as the DN. You specify the DN as a comma-separated list in quotes. For example,
`"CN=sample.payara.fish,OU=Payara,O=Payara Foundation,L=Great Malvern,ST=Worcestershire,C=UK"`.

NOTE: The `enable-secure-admin-principal` subcommand accepts the string you enter and does not immediately validate it. However, secure admin must be able to match the DN you specify in order to use it.

If you have sufficient privileges to view the content of the keystore, you can use keytool to display the DN of a certificate:

[source,shell]

If you use the `--alias aliasname` form, then Payara Server looks in its truststore for a certificate with the specified alias and uses the DN associated with that certificate. `aliasname` must be an alias associated with a certificate currently in the truststore.

When you run `enable-secure-admin`, Payara Server automatically records the DNs for the admin alias and the instance alias, whether you specify those values or use the defaults. You do not need to run `enable-secure-admin-principal` yourself for those certificates.

Other than these certificates, you must run `enable-secure-admin-principal` for any other DN that Payara Server should authorize to send admin requests. This includes DNs corresponding to trusted certificates (those with a certificate chain to a trusted authority.)

You can run `enable-secure-admin-principal` multiple times so that Payara Server accepts admin requests from a client sending a certificate with any of the DNs you specify.

The following example shows how to specify a `DN` for authorizing access in secure administration:

[source,shell]
----
asadmin enable-secure-admin-principal
"CN=sample.payara.fish,OU=Payara,O=Payara Foundation,L=Great Malvern,ST=Worcestershire,C=UK"

Command enable-secure-admin-principal executed successfully.
----

You can use the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/disable-secure-admin-principal.adoc#disable-secure-admin-principal[`disable-secure-admin-principal`] subcommand to disable a specific certificate for authenticating and authorizing access in secure admin. You must specify either the DN or the `--alias` option of the `disable-secure-admin-principal` subcommand. To disable multiple certificates for authenticating and authorizing access in secure admin, run the `disable-secure-admin-principal` subcommand multiple times.

You can use the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-secure-admin-principals.adoc[`list-secure-admin-principals`] subcommand to list the certificates for which Payara Server accepts admin requests from clients.

[[guarding-against-unwanted-connections]]
=== Guarding Against Unwanted Connections

Secure admin guards against unwanted connections in several ways:

* *DAS-to-DAS, instance-to-instance*:

** The DAS and the instances have copies of the same truststore, which contains the public certificate of the DAS and the separate public certificate that is used by all instances. In addition, Payara Server includes a unique, generated "domain ID" that servers use to ensure that admin requests from other Payara Servers originate from the correct domain.

** DAS-to-other-DAS communication is not authenticated because each different DAS will have its own self-signed certificate that is not in the truststore of the other DAS.

** DAS-to-itself communication is unlikely unless you were to mis-configure the admin listener port for an instance on the same host, so it is the same as for the DAS. Similarly, instance-to-instance traffic is unlikely unless you were to mis-configure listener ports for instances on the same host.
+
To prevent both of these situations, both cases are handled by making sure that the connecting `Principal` (alias) is not the running `Principal`. Secure admin ensures that if the client has authenticated using SSL/TLS client authentication that the `Principal` associated with the remote client is not the same as the current process. That is, the DAS makes sure that the `Principal` is not itself. Similarly, each instance ensures that the client is not an instance. (The instances share the same self-signed certificate and therefore are mapped to the same `Principal`)

* Remote client-to-instance:
+
Remote `asadmin` clients are unable to connect directly to instances. If the user on host "test1" runs a local command but specifies a remote instance on host "test2," `asadmin` on "test1" will read and send that locally-provisioned password. The instance on "test2" will have a different locally-provisioned password and so the authentication attempt will fail.
+
Therefore, a user on "test1" will not be able to run a remote command targeting an instance on "test2."

[[considerations-when-running-payara-server-with-default-security]]
== Considerations When Running Payara Server With Default Security

In Payara Server, the default admin account has the username "admin" with an empty password credentials. By default, admin clients provide empty credentials or none at all, and all are authenticated and authorized as that default admin user. None of the participants (clients, DAS, or instances) encrypts network messages.

If this level of security is acceptable in your environment, no changes are needed, you do not need to enable secure administration.

NOTE: Imposing a heightened level of security is optional, but recommended on most public-facing production environments.

However, consider the following table, which shows which operations are accepted and rejected when secure admin is disabled.

NOTE: When secure admin is disabled, Payara Server does allow remote monitoring (read-only) access via the REST interface.

[[running-secure-admin]]
== Running Secure Admin

This section describes how to run secure admin. The section begins with prerequisites for running secure admin.

[[prerequisites-for-running-secure-admin]]
=== Prerequisites for Running Secure Admin

Before running Payara Server with secure admin enabled, you must make sure that:

. The DAS is initialized and running.
. If one or more remote instances are installed and initialized, they must not be running.
. Any administration clients you require are installed.
. The username and password sent by remote administration clients (`asadmin`, administration console, browsers, and IDEs) must exist in the realm and be in the admin group.
. The keystore and truststore for the domain exist. (They are created by default when you create the domain)
+
NOTE: If you are not using the default self-signed certificates, you must add your own valid certificates (including CA root certificates) in the keystore and truststore, respectively.

. If you are not using the default self-signed certificates, create two aliases corresponding to certificates in the keystore and truststore: one that the DAS will use for authenticating itself in administration traffic, and one that the instances will use for authenticating itself in administration traffic.
+
TIP: For convenience, you can use the same certificate alias for both DAS access and DAS-to-instance communication.

[[an-alternate-approach-using-a-user-name-and-password-for-internal-authentication-and-authorization]]
=== An Alternate Approach: Using A Username and Password for Internal Authentication and Authorization

By default, secure admin uses the Payara Server self-signed certificates, via the aliases corresponding to these certificates, to authenticate the DAS and instances with each other and to authorize secure admin operations. Specifically, the DAS uses the (`s1as`) alias for authenticating itself and authorizing access in administration traffic, and instances use the (`glassfish-instance`) alias for authenticating themselves and authorizing access in secure admin traffic.

As described in xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Security Guide/Managing Administrative Security.adoc#using-your-own-certificates[Using Your Own Certificates], you can instead use your own certificates and their associated aliases for authenticating and authorizing the DAS and instances in administration traffic and communication.

As an alternative to this certificate-based authentication and authorization, you can instead use the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/enable-secure-admin-internal-user.adoc#enable-secure-admin-internal-user[`enable-secure-admin-internal-user`] subcommand to instruct all servers in the domain to authenticate to each other, and to authorize admin operations submitted to each other, using an existing admin username and password rather than certificates.

NOTE: If secure admin is enabled, all Payara Server processes continue to use SSL encryption to secure the content of the admin messages, regardless of how they authenticate to each other.

You might want to use the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/enable-secure-admin-internal-user.adoc#enable-secure-admin-internal-user[`enable-secure-admin-internal-user`] subcommand if your use case favors the use of a username and password combination over the use of SSL certificates and aliases.

This generally means that you must:

. Create a valid admin user.
+
[source,shell]
----
asadmin> create-file-user --authrealmname admin-realm --groups
asadmin newAdminUsername
----

. Create a password alias for the password credential of the newly created user.
+
[source,shell]
----
asadmin> create-password-alias passwordAliasName
----

The following example allows secure admin to use a username and password alias for authentication and authorization between the DAS and instances, instead of certificates.

[source,shell]
----
asadmin> enable-secure-admin-internal-user --passwordalias passwordAliasName newAdminUsername
----

If Payara Server finds at least one secure admin internal user, then if secure admin is enabled Payara Server processes will not use SSL authentication and authorization with each other and will instead use basic authentication through username and password credentials.

Most users who use this subcommand will need to set up only one secure admin internal user. If you set up more than one secure admin internal user, you should not make any assumptions about which username and password pair Payara Server will choose to use for any given admin request.

IMPORTANT: As a general practice, you should not use the same username and password pair for internal admin communication and for admin user login. That is, always create at least one admin account specifically for internal admin communication if you prefer to use this method.

You can use the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/disable-secure-admin-internal-user.adoc#disable-secure-admin-internal-user[`disable-secure-admin-internal-user`] subcommand to disable secure admin from using the username/password credentials to authenticate the DAS and instances with each other and to authorize admin operations.

To disable multiple usernames for authenticating and authorizing access in secure admin, run the `disable-secure-admin-internal-user` subcommand multiple times.

You can use the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-secure-admin-internal-users.adoc#list-secure-admin-internal-users[`list-secure-admin-internal-users`] subcommand to list the usernames for which Payara Server authenticate the DAS and instances with each other and authorizes admin operations.

== Additional Considerations When Creating Local Instances

If you use `*-local-instance` variant commands to set up local instances (which are run locally from within the node host where the instance has been installed), either leave secure admin disabled, or enable it before you create or start the instances and leave it that way.

However, if you use `*-instance` variant commands over SSH to manage remote instances (which are run from the DAS), you can enable and disable secure admin, although this is not recommended because it can result in an inconsistent security model.

[[secure-admin-use-case]]
== Secure Admin Use Case

This section describes a simple secure admin use case.

In the `asadmin --secure=false --user me --passwordfile myFile.txt cmd ...` use case, the user submits a command with `--secure` set to false, and supplies password credentials.

The important concept to note is that `asadmin` uses HTTPS because of the DAS redirection, even though the command sets `--secure` to false. `asadmin` sends the HTTP Authorization header along with the redirected request.

In addition to the flow described here, certificate authentication is also performed as described in the following table. Also, the credentials that the user supplies are assumed to be valid administrator credentials for the DAS.
