    <groupId>fish.payara.maven.extensions</groupId>
    <artifactId>regex-profile-activator</artifactId>
    <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>

This extension is now active in your build, and you can activate profiles using a regex string beginning and ending with a `/`.

[source,XML]
.Example usage of Maven Regex Profile Activation in a `pom.xml` file

<profile>
    <id>test-profile</id>
    <activation>
        <property>
