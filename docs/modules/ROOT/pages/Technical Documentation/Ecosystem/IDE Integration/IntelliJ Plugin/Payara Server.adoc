To add the Payara Server to the configuration, click the *Configure...* button and set it to the Payara Server's installation path you would like to add to the IDE.

Specify the path to the JRE or JDK version you would like Payara Server to run on.

Finally, fix the debugger related warning by pressing the *Fix* button, which updates the debugger settings in the domains.xml of the selected Payara Server's domain.

For now, ignore the `No artifacts marked for deployment` warning and click *OK* to save the configuration

Click the *Run or Debug* button from top-right panel to start Payara Server, or start Payara Server in debug mode, which would allow you to debug deployed applications

After application deployed to the Payara Server, IntelliJ starts a web browser and opens the application context root in the web browser.

[[deploy-to-docker-container]]
== Deploy Applications in a Local Docker Container

The Payara Server tools for IntelliJ IDEA include Docker integration, making it seamless to deploy exploded applications to a Payara Server instance running within a local Docker container.

. Run the Payara Server Docker container using the following command:
+
[source, shell]
----
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 4848:4848 -p 9009:9009 -v HOST_PATH:CONTAINER_PATH  payara/server-full:{page-version}
----
+
Replace `HOST_PATH` with the actual host path and `CONTAINER_PATH` with the desired container path that must be the exploded application path or parent path of application.
+
The `HOST_PATH` points to the location on your host machine, and `CONTAINER_PATH` is the corresponding location inside the container.
. Open Intellij IDEA Ultimate and first create the new *Payara Server configuration* by selecting the *Edit Configuration* option:
. In the *Run/Debug Configurations* dialog, click `+`, expand the *Payara Server* node, and select *Remote*.

. To add the Payara Server to the configuration, click the *Configure...* button and set it to the Payara Server's installation path with the same version as the one running in the Docker container.
. For Docker integration, choose the "Docker Volume" option and provide the `HOST_PATH` (e.g., `D:/test`) and `CONTAINER_PATH` (e.g., `/mnt/test`) mapping details.
+
This mapping should align with the exploded application path or parent path of exploded application.
. Navigate to the *Deployment* section and click on the `+` button to select *Artifact...*.
. Click *OK*
. Click the *Run or Debug* button from top-right panel to deploy the application to the registered Payara Server docker instance.

[[deploy-applications-in-wsl]]
== Deploy Applications in a WSL Environment

Another noteworthy feature is the integration of the Payara Server Tools with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

This integration empowers developers to manage and deploy exploded applications to a Payara Server instance running within WSL.

Here's how you can make use of this feature:

. Start the Payara Server instance within WSL:
.. Run the following command to start the server:
+
[source, shell]
----
./asadmin start-domain
----
.. Set a password for the admin user:
+
[source, shell]
----
./asadmin change-admin-password
----
.. Enable secure admin:
+
[source, shell]
----
./asadmin enable-secure-admin
----
.. Restart the Payara Server domain:
+
[source, shell]
----
./asadmin restart-domain
----

. Register the WSL-based Payara Server instance in the IntelliJ IDEA:
.. Open Intellij IDEA Ultimate and first create the new *Payara Server configuration* by selecting the *Edit Configuration* option:

.. In the *Run/Debug Configurations* dialog, click `+`, expand the *Payara Server* node, and select *Remote*.

.. To add the Payara Server to the configuration, click the *Configure...* button and set it to the Payara Server's installation path running within WSL on your Windows machine.
.. For WSL integration, choose the "WSL" option and make sure *Use SSL Connection* option is checked.
.. Enter the host (fetched via the command `hostname -I` in WSL instance) and the necessary credentials.
.. Navigate to the *Deployment* section and click on the *+* button to select *Artifact...*.
.. Click *OK*
.. Click the *Run or Debug* button from top-right panel to deploy the application to the registered Payara Server WSL environment.
