= Payara Server Apache NetBeans IDE Support
:ordinal: 1

The Apache NetBeans IDE has built-in integration with Payara Server and allows you to easily perform the following tasks:

* Start and stop the Payara Server from within the IDE
* Define the Java runtime to be used by Payara Server
* Deploy an application from within the IDE
* Auto Publish & Hot Deploy your application

Browse to the location of the Payara Server installation. If the DAS is on another machine, make sure to select the remote domain option. Otherwise, use the local domain option.

The following details are configurable on the next screen:

* Domain -> The domain you want to use. The default domain is *domain1*.
* Host -> The hostname the server will be listening on. the default hostname is *localhost*.
* DAS Port -> The port used by the DAS. The default port is *4848*.
* HTTP Port -> The port used by the deployed applications. The default port is *8080*.
* Target -> The name of the node that the application will be getting deployed to. This can be left blank for a local installation.
* Username -> The admin username for Payara Server. The default username is *admin*.
* Password -> The admin password for Payara Server. The default password is blank.

== Managing Payara Server from Apache NetBeans IDE

Once the configuration is complete, you can manage your Payara Server directly from Apache NetBeans. By right-clicking on the previously-configured server, we can do the following actions:

* Start or stop the server
* Start debugging the server
* Open the admin console
* Open the server.log file

image::apache-netbeans/payara-server/netbeans-server-details-payara6.png[Server Details,align="center"]

Exploding the server dropdown will list Applications, Resources and Web Services. This allows you to view and manage certain Payara Server configurations, from the NetBeans interface.

[[deploying-application-payara-netbeans]]
== Deploying Applications to Payara Server from Apache NetBeans IDE

An application can be deployed and un-deployed easily from within Apache NetBeans. First, the application run settings need to be configured to use Payara Server. Go to Properties on a project and then the Run section of this window. This menu lists the configuration for deploying the application.

Select the Payara Server you have configured. You can also select a context path for the application to be deployed to, as well as NetBeans behaviour when deploying.

Deploying to Payara Server now only requires running the application like any other NetBeans project. Once itâ€™s deployed, the Services view will then display the application under Payara Server, where you can undeploy, enable, disable and view the application in the browser.

[[deploy-to-docker-container]]
== Deploy Applications in a Local Docker Container

The Payara Server tools for Apache NetBeans include Docker integration, making it seamless to deploy exploded applications to a Payara Server instance running within a local Docker container.

To take advantage of this feature, follow these steps below:

. Open Apache NetBeans and navigate to the _Services_ tab.
. Register a new Payara Server instance by performing the following:
.. Click on the "_Add Server_" button.
.. Select the "_Remote Domain_" option.
.. Browse and locate the Payara Server installation directory with the same version as the one running in the Docker container.
.. Enter the domain name, host, and necessary credentials.
.. For the Docker integration, choose the "_Docker Volume_" option and provide the `HOST_PATH` (e.g., `D:/test`) and `CONTAINER_PATH` (e.g., `/mnt/test`) mapping details.
+
This mapping should align with the exploded application path or parent path of exploded application.

. Run the Payara Server Docker container using the following command:
+
[source, shell]
----
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 4848:4848 -p 9009:9009 -v HOST_PATH:CONTAINER_PATH  payara/server-full:{page-version}
----
+
Replace `HOST_PATH` with the actual host path and `CONTAINER_PATH` with the desired container path.
+
The `HOST_PATH` points to the location on your host machine, and `CONTAINER_PATH` is the corresponding location inside the container.

. Create your web application and deploy it to the registered Payara Server instance.

[[hot-deploy-and-auto-deploy-settings]]
== Hot Deploy and Auto Deploy Settings

To enable the *Auto Deploy* features for Payara Server on the Apache NetBeans IDE, you must enable the *Compile on Save* and *Deploy on Save* features from the *Project Properties*.

*Compile on Save* can be found in the *Build->Compile* submenu of the project properties.
