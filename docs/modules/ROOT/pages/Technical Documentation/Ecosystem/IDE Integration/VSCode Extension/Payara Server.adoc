[[deploy-to-docker-container]]
== Deploy Applications in a Local Docker Container

The Payara Server tools for the VS Code extension includes Docker integration, making it seamless to deploy exploded applications to a Payara Server instance running within a local Docker container.

To take advantage of this feature, follow these steps below:

. Register a new Payara Server instance by performing the following:
.. Open the command pallet using `Ctrl + Shift + P`, type *Payara* and select the *Add Payara Server* option.
.. Select Remote Domain.
.. For Docker integration, choose the "Docker" type and provide the `HOST_PATH` (e.g., `D:/test`) and `CONTAINER_PATH` (e.g., `/mnt/test`) mapping details.
+
This mapping should align with the exploded application path or parent path of exploded application.
.. Choose a name for the server.
.. Enter the domain name, host name, and necessary credentials.

. Run the Payara Server Docker container using the following command:
+
[source, shell]
----
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 4848:4848 -p 9009:9009 -v HOST_PATH:CONTAINER_PATH  payara/server-full:{page-version}
----
+
Replace `HOST_PATH` with the actual host path and `CONTAINER_PATH` with the desired container path. The `HOST_PATH` points to the location on your host machine, and `CONTAINER_PATH` is the corresponding location inside the container.

. Create your web application and deploy it to the registered Payara Server instance.

[[deploy-applications-in-wsl]]
== Deploy Applications in a WSL Environment

Another noteworthy feature is the integration of the Payara Server Tools with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

This integration empowers developers to manage and deploy exploded applications to a Payara Server instance running within WSL.

Here's how you can make use of this feature:

. Start the Payara Server instance within WSL:
.. Run the following command to start the server:
+
[source, shell]
----
./asadmin start-domain
----
.. Set a password for the admin user:
+
[source, shell]
----
./asadmin change-admin-password
----
.. Enable secure admin:
+
[source, shell]
----
./asadmin enable-secure-admin
----
.. Restart the Payara Server domain:
+
[source, shell]
----
./asadmin restart-domain
----

.. Fetch the IP address of WSL environment using the command `hostname -I` and enter it in the `host name` field in the VS Code settings.

. Register the WSL-based Payara Server instance in VS Code:
.. Open the command pallet using `Ctrl + Shift + P`, type *Payara* and select the *Add Payara Server* option.
.. Select Remote Domain.
.. For WSL integration, choose the `WSL` instance type.
.. Choose a name for the server.
.. Enter the domain name, host name (fetched via the command `hostname -I` in WSL instance), and necessary credentials.

. Create your web application and deploy it to the registered Payara Server instance.
