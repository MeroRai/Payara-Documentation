This section describes Apache Maven support for Payara Micro.

[[artifacts-in-maven-central]]
== Maven Central Artifacts

Payara Micro is available in Maven Central, allowing you to include it as a dependency in your project's POM. This allows you to easily add the required Payara Micro classes and methods to your application to use Payara Micro programmatically.

To do this, use the following GAV coordinates:

[source, xml, subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>fish.payara.extras</groupId>
    <artifactId>payara-micro</artifactId>
    <version>{page-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

IMPORTANT: The xref:/Technical Documentation/Public API/Overview.adoc[Public API] dependency must be also added to the project's POM when developing applications that use proprietary features (`@Clustered` or `@NamedCache` for example).
