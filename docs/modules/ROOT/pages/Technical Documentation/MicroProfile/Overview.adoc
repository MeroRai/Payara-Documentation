== What is Eclipse MicroProfile?
The MicroProfile project was launched in June 2016 as a collaborative effort between Java application server vendors and the enterprise Java community to enable fast innovation.

MicroProfile is a specification which provides a set of APIs focused on microservices. The complete MicroProfile API is provided as a Bill Of Materials(BOM) which can be used by developers as a generic dependency provided by a vendor of their choice.

Payara has been part of the MicroProfile project from its inception and, therefore, supports all specifications of the MicroProfile Umbrella project.

== Payara Support for MicroProfile

Version 6.1::
Version 6.1 of MicroProfile is a minor release that updates Metrics, Config and Telemetry. Also, this version aligns with Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile and continues with the `jakarta.*` namespace alignment and allows to be certified with Java SE 11 or higher.

This is supported by Payara Platform starting from releases *6.2023.11*/*6.8.0* onwards

Version 6.0::
Version 6.0 of MicroProfile is a major release that updates JWT Authentication, OpenAPI, and Metrics.
In addition, this version introduces OpenTelemetry Tracing as a replacement for OpenTracing (which is now an optional specification), as well as bringing in Jakarta EE Core Profile 10.0 in place of the individual Jakarta specifications it pulled in previously (CDI, JAX-RS, Annotations, JSON-B, and JSON-P).

This is supported by the Payara Platform starting from release *6.2023.3*
