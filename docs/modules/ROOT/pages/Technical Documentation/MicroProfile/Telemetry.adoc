= Eclipse MicroProfile Telemetry

Payara Platform {page-version} provides MicroProfile Telemetry  {mpTelemetryVersion}.

The aim of the spec is to adopt https://opentelemetry.io[OpenTelemetry] into MicroProfile applications, so they can benefit from distributed tracing.

OpenTelemetry thus becomes the primary observability API in Payara Platform.

OpenTelemetry defines more types of signals.
As of version {page-version} and in line with MicroProfile spec, support is only provided for Tracing aspects for the API.

For more details about configuration of OpenTelemetry refer to xref:Technical Documentation/MicroProfile/OpenTelemetry and OpenTracing.adoc[OpenTelemetry documentation] for application development.
