= Metrics Configuration in Payara Platform

On Payara Server, the MicroProfile Metrics service can be configured by using Admin Console or Asadmin commands.

Payara Micro doesn't have a convenient solution for its MicroProfile Metrics service configuration yet.

== Using the Admin Console

To configure the Metrics in the Admin Console, go to Configuration -> [instance-configuration (like `server-config`)] -> MicroProfile -> Metrics:

[[using-asadmin-commands]]
== Using Asadmin Commands

Use the following commands to manipulate the configuration settings of the service:

== Security Configuration Considerations

By default, the MicroProfile Metrics endpoint binds to the root context application which is the `__default-web-module` (also known as *docroot*) system application and the `__default-web-module` application, which is secured under the default realm (`file`) of the server domain.

If a user application is deployed in the empty *context-root*, then the security configuration of this application will be shared by the MicroProfile Metrics endpoint, so _exert extreme caution_ when making these changes.
