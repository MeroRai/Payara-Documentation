= Eclipse MicroProfile Health Check API

The Payara Platform {page-version} provides MicroProfile HealthCheck {mpHealthVersion}

[[background]]
== Background

The Health Check API was created to allow easier probing of the state of computing nodes that live in a cloud infrastructure environment.

{mpHealthSpecUrl}[The complete specification] can be found on the Eclipse MicroProfile website.

Breaking changes introduced in MicroProfile Health {mpHealthVersion} are listed in the official specification under {mpHealthSpecUrl}#_incompatible_changes[Incompatible Changes]

[[rest-endpoints]]
== REST Endpoints

The MicroProfile HealthCheck API defines the following list of REST endpoints that are available from the root context at `/health/+${type}+` by default:

[cols="1,1,3",options="header"]
|====
|Context
|Type
|Description

|`/health/live`
|Liveness
|On invocation, all registered health checks annotated with `@Liveness` are performed and the results aggregated.

|`/health/ready`
|Readiness
|On invocation, all registered health checks annotated with `@Readiness` are performed and the results aggregated.

|`/health/started`
|Startup
|On invocation, all registered health checks annotated with '@Startup' are performed and the results aggregated.

|`/health`
|Readiness + Liveness + Startup
|On invocation, all registered health checks annotated with `@Liveness`, `@Readiness`, or `@Startup` are performed and the results aggregated.
|====

TIP: On Payara Server, this root endpoint can be altered using the `set-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration` asadmin command to prevent collisions with other HTTP endpoints that might need to use the `health` context root.

IMPORTANT: This endpoint will not be available until at least one application has been deployed.

[[health-check-configuration]]
== Health Check Configuration

On Payara Server, the MicroProfile HealthCheck settings can be configured by using Admin Console or Asadmin commands.

[[using-the-admin-console]]
=== Using the Admin Console

To configure the Health Check in the Admin Console, go to Configuration -> [instance-configuration (like `server-config`)] -> MicroProfile -> Health Check:

[[using-asadmin-commands]]
=== Using Asadmin Commands

The following administration commands can be used to configure the MicroProfile Healthcheck service:

* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/set-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration.adoc#set-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration[`set-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration`]
* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/get-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration.adoc#get-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration[`get-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration`]

IMPORTANT: Changes made with this command will only be applied when the server or instance is restarted.

[[security-configuration]]
=== Security Configuration

By default, HealthCheck endpoints bind to the root context application which is the `__default-web-module` (also known as *docroot*) system application and the `__default-web-module` application, which is secured under the default realm (`file`) of the server.

If a user application is deployed in the empty context-root, then the security configuration of this application will be shared by the HealthCheck endpoints, so _exert extreme caution_ when making these changes.

[[microprofile-upgrade]]
== Upgrading from Eclipse MicroProfile 3.x to 4.x

MicroProfile 4.0 brings with it a number of changes to MicroProfile Health. The main incompatible change brought in by this upgrade is the removal of the deprecated `@Health` annotation.

There isn't a workaround for this, the annotation is simply gone: all health checks must be registered as a `@Readiness`, `@Liveness`, or `@Startup` check.
