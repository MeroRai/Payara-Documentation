== Known Issue
=== Hazelcast Warning
* The Hazelcast 5.3.1 upgrade adds socket options for per-socket keep-alive configuration. When running Payara on Windows, this version of Hazelcast throws a warning in the server logs, similar to this: "Ignoring TCP_KEEPCOUNT. It seems your JDK does not support jdk.net.ExtendedSocketOptions on this OS. Try upgrading to the latest JDK or check with your JDK vendor.Alternatively, on Linux, configure tcp_keepalive_probes in the kernel (affecting default keep-alive configuration for all sockets): For more info see [https://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/[keep alive]]. If this isn't dealt with, idle connections could be closed prematurely." This is a Hazelcast known issue that is documented [https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.3/clusters/network-configuration#configuring-tcp-keep-alive[here]].
